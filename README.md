# C1_w2_linear_Regression
It's my assignment in Machin learning Class
in this project I used linear regression to process our data to implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a restaurant franchise.
 also have data on cities that are candidates for a new restaurant.x_train is the population of a city
y_train is the profit of a restaurant in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.
As you may recall from the lecture, for one variable, the cost function for linear regression  𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)
  is defined.
  after that, I implemented the gradient for parameters  𝑤,𝑏
  for linear regression.
  and after that find the optimal parameters of a linear regression model by using batch gradient descent. Recall batch refers to running all the examples in one iteration.
